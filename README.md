# CharPanelLongPress

- does not make an entry in Extensions menu
- has no customization settings

Two longpress gestures for the character panel.

1. Longpress a character in the character list >>> select that character, open their chat, and auto-close the character panel.
2. Longpress the character panel icon in the top bar >>> open the character panel with the character list showing.

Normal tap interactions for both targets still work as normal.
